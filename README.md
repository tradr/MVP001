Prototype marketplace dapp utilising the ARDOR/NXT API calls on a mobile device

Initial goal:

Helping buyers and sellers transact privately, securely, quickly and safely in farmers markets using TRADR child coin on Ardor blockchain.

Key objectives:

1. Get marketplace data out of blockchain and display securely on mobile device (iOS & Android). 
(See ethereum GO-Etherium mobile efforts - how can we do this on Ardor?)

2. Establish trust system between buyers and sellers regarding specific marketplace product categories/tags

3. Allow user privacy whilst also displaying products in local area using mobile geo data
